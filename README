GSM_Direct:

	Sending SMS directly using GSM modem

GSM_UBlox:

	Sending SMS with UBlox-C027
	Meant to be easy to modify for use in other Demo-Projects...
	
General:

Wiring:

        BBB -> UBLOX
	P9_1 -> GND
	P9_11 -> TX
	P9_13 -> RX

	Template compression:

	removed "FMR0"
	all tailing 0 in the templates are removed, instead a number indicating the number of tailing 0s is appended to the end
	template is compressed using zip.py, which is a library written by me that encodes 3 hexadecimals into 2 characters in a 64-char system
	in the first SMS, the header is encoded in the following way:
		prime_table = [1,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43]
		z = n * m * e
		where :
			e = 2 if enrollment, 1 otherwise
			n = xth object in prime_table, x is the segment id
			m = yth object in prime_table, y is the total number of segemnts
			z should be an integer < 4096 (0xfff)
			header = z compressed into 2 64-char

//IF YOU SEE ANYTHING WIERD, BLAME IT ON THE NOISE FIRST!!!
